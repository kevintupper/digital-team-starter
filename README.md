Yes — exactly. That’s the leap from “chatbot copilots” to “agentic systems.”

Let me revise the README framing so it captures that agents = answers + actions, and why curated knowledge is foundational when agents are trusted to operate.

# Digital Team Starter

A starter kit for creating curated SharePoint Knowledge Bases (KBs) and surfacing them as Copilot Studio agents.  
Built to be **repeatable, auditable, and simple** — designed for enterprises and government.

## 🌐 Big Picture

As we move toward **reimagining government with AI** and becoming a *Frontier Agency*,  
the way agencies manage and use knowledge must evolve.

- **Domain experts** are no longer just subject-matter specialists — they are **curators of knowledge**.  
- That curated knowledge becomes the **critical input** for AI-powered agents.  
- **Agents are not only chatbots** giving answers — they are increasingly **action-oriented teammates**.  
  - An HR policy agent may answer a question today.  
  - Tomorrow, it may also **submit a leave request**, **initiate a workflow**, or **approve a form** — on your behalf.  

When agents are empowered to act, the **quality and trustworthiness of their knowledge** becomes even more critical.  
Without curated, approved data → actions risk being wrong or unauthorized.  
With curated, approved data → actions are **accurate, auditable, and aligned with agency policy**.  

👉 This starter kit shows how to stand up that pattern inside Microsoft 365:  
curated Draft → Approved → Published knowledge bases, tied directly into Copilot Studio agents —  
so your Digital Team can deliver **both trusted answers and safe actions**.

## 📂 Repo Structure (planned)

```
digital-team-starter/
├─ provisioning/        # PowerShell scripts (PnP, Graph) for schema + KB setup
├─ flows/               # Power Automate templates (approvals, copy to published)
├─ solutions/           # Copilot Studio agent templates (Solution packages)
├─ docs/                # Playbook, diagrams, story
└─ README.md            # This file
```

## 🪜 Steps (to be built out)

1. **Define schema**  
   - Site columns (`KbTitle`, `KbDescription`, `KbTags`)  
   - KB Article content type  

2. **Provision a domain KB**  
   - Create Draft + Published libraries (`kb-<slug>-draft`, `kb-<slug>`)  
   - Attach KB Article content type  
   - Configure versioning, approvals, views  
   - Assign groups (`kb-<slug>-editors`, `kb-<slug>-approvers`)  

3. **Bootstrap an agent**  
   - Create Copilot Studio agent (`agent-<slug>`)  
   - Attach Published library as knowledge  
   - Apply standard system prompt & starter Q&A  
   - Enable baseline **actions** (feedback, escalation, task initiation)

4. **Operational flows**  
   - Approval → Copy Draft → Published (with metadata)  
   - Feedback capture list + action  
   - Review reminders  

---

## 🔄 Flows (to be added)

- **Provisioning flow** (PS scripts → libraries, CTs, groups)  
- **Approval flow** (PA → copy to Published, notify Teams)  
- **Agent bootstrap flow** (Solution import, connect to KB)  
- **Action flows** (PA + connectors → allow agents to do work when authorized)

## 📜 Status

- [ ] Step 1: Schema defined  
- [ ] Step 2: First domain KB provisioned  
- [ ] Step 3: First agent bootstrapped (answers + actions baseline)  
- [ ] Step 4: Operational flows added

## 📖 Roadmap

We’ll expand this README as we go.  
Each time we add a script, step, or flow, this file will be updated to document it.
